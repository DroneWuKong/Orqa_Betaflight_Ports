# APB logging — quick start

Use the companion package for the firmware you actually flashed: PX4,
ArduPilot or Betaflight. Each bundle identifies its own profile; no guessing or
automatic firmware switching. The same commands work in all three packages.
Use the [disarmed logging acceptance checklist](BENCH_ACCEPTANCE.md) to record
physical results separately from host tests.
The i.MX writes the SD card.

**These commands run on the APB Linux companion, not your PC or flight controller.**
Keep the extracted package for later setup/rollback. Python 3.10+ and systemd
are required. For MAVLink profiles, the existing router must already own UART4
and load `/etc/mavlink-router/config.d`; PX4 requires the tested v4 router.
This helper does not install/replace the core router or a Linux image.

## 1. Prepare once

- Back up settings. Props off, FC disarmed, correct firmware/sensor variant.
- Insert a working SD card. Do not format or erase anything for this setup.
- Confirm the FC settings below. Existing saved settings override defaults.
- Stop/disable a previous firmware family's logger explicitly before switching.
  Betaflight also needs the MAVLink router stopped/disabled on the bench so MSP
  can own the UART. The tool refuses conflicts; it never stops another family.

| Firmware | Required settings | What gets stored |
|---|---|---|
| PX4 | Matching APB logging firmware, MAVLink2 UART4 at 230400, SDLOG_MODE not -1 | Compact live ULog, not full-rate tuning data |
| ArduPilot | SERIAL4_PROTOCOL=2, SERIAL4_BAUD=230, LOG_BACKEND_TYPE=4; LOG_DISARMED=0 recommended | Verified onboard-log recovery after disarm |
| Betaflight | UART4 MSP at 115200, blackbox_device=FLASH | Blackbox offload after disarm, not live streaming |

For full details and firmware/parameter rollback, see [README.md](README.md).
Confirm the existing MAVLink router uses the same UART baud for PX4/ArduPilot.
Do not remove a live-logging backend until its FC parameters are restored on
the bench; an absent ArduPilot live receiver can affect the logging/prearm check.

## 2. Install and start

Verify the downloaded package checksum, extract it, and open the directory
containing `easy.py`. Use a firmware/companion pair from one verified release:
PX4 rc3, ArduPilot rc2,
or Betaflight rc3 (all v0.1.0 prereleases). See this repository's
[release audit and exact file selection](https://github.com/DroneWuKong/Orqa_Betaflight_Ports/blob/main/docs/APB_RELEASE_AUDIT_2026-10-24.md)
on GitHub if using an extracted archive. The archive does not contain the full
repository. **Older bundles without easy.py do not have this helper**; do not
combine their firmware with a moving main/master or unrelated CI package.
For a newer build, verify both firmware and companion against that exact source
revision. Do not mix individual files from different revisions.

~~~sh
sudo python3 easy.py setup --activate --bench
~~~

`--bench` means you have verified disarmed/props-off state and the FC settings.
It is an explicit acknowledgment, not automatic detection of a safe aircraft.
For PX4/ArduPilot, activation restarts the existing router once, interrupting
telemetry. Never run setup/start/stop/rollback in flight.

Setup installs pinned Python dependencies into the package's dedicated venv
(ArduPilot/Betaflight), preflights destination files, and repairs only the
recognized vendor SD helper with a backup. Existing/custom mount helpers are
preserved. It never formats SD, deletes logs, changes FC parameters, flashes
firmware, or automatically chooses a different logger.

To install without starting: `sudo python3 easy.py setup --bench`.
Then start with `sudo python3 easy.py start --bench`.
ArduPilot live logging is optional: after explicitly setting
`LOG_BACKEND_TYPE=6` and rebooting on the bench, add `--live` to setup with
activation or to start. This retains the archive worker. Live streams have no
complete-log guarantee; keep onboard recording enabled.

Networkless installation: add `--wheels /path/to/wheelhouse` to setup. Supply
the pinned dependencies and their dependencies as wheels for the companion's
Python version/ARM64 architecture. Python venv/pip support must already exist.
The tool does not change OS package repositories.

## 3. Check it

~~~sh
sudo python3 easy.py status
sudo python3 easy.py logs
~~~

Status reports runtime dependencies, UART presence, actual SD mount/free space,
conflicting services, and recorder service state. Add `--live` when checking
the optional ArduPilot live recorder, or `--json` for machine-readable output.
Any failed required check returns a nonzero exit code with an explanation.
The UART check proves only that `/dev/ttymxc2` is a character device. Independently
verify actual UART ownership, baud/protocol, router config-directory loading,
free UDP ports and source identity. Known service checks cannot find every
manually started serial program or competing GCS log client.
`logs --follow` follows the recorder journals.

An active service is **not proof of a received/complete log**. Read the journal,
confirm files appear in `/sdcard/px4`, `/sdcard/ardupilot`, or
`/sdcard/betaflight`, and open them with the correct log parser. For ArduPilot
and Betaflight, a finalized capture needs its JSON receipt and matching SHA256;
preserve `.partial` files. Archive offloads can take minutes.

## Stop or undo activation

~~~sh
sudo python3 easy.py stop --bench
# Also remove this profile's router endpoint from service, retaining a backup:
sudo python3 easy.py rollback --bench
~~~

Stop disables only this profile's recorder units. For PX4/ArduPilot, rollback
additionally moves
its unchanged router endpoint to `/var/lib/orqa-logging/rollback` and restarts
the core router if it was active. Customized endpoints are refused.
Both preserve logs, dependencies, runtime files and the shared SD repair.
Betaflight has no router endpoint to remove and does not re-enable MAVLink.
This is companion deactivation, not firmware/FC-parameter rollback. For an
ArduPilot live-to-archive change, restore block-only FC logging and reboot on the
bench, then stop both units and start without `--live`; omitting `--live` alone
does not disable a previously enabled live unit.
To reactivate after rollback, run setup again.

If any command fails, inspect its error and run status/logs. A partly completed
setup can be rerun after fixing the issue; unrecognized files are never
overwritten. Do not delete backups or force changes to bypass a guard.

For image builders/tests only: `python3 easy.py setup --root /path/to/staging`
stages files without dependencies, network calls or host service operations.
It cannot be combined with activation/live/dependency options.

Physical SD persistence, UART load and power-loss behavior still require the
APB bench checks. This convenience layer does not confer hardware qualification.
